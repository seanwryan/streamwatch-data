# StreamWatch Data Cleaning Verification Plan
## How to Check That Data Cleaning Worked Correctly

**Goal:** Make sure all data cleaning was done correctly  
**What to check:** All 14 database tables and their data  
**How to check:** Go through each column in each table systematically  
**Time needed:** 2-3 weeks to check everything

---

## üéØ **How We'll Check the Data**

### **Two Ways to Check:**

#### **1. Compare Database to Excel**
- **How:** Look at cleaned database data vs original Excel files
- **Good for:** Quick spot-checks of specific changes
- **Use when:** You want to verify specific transformations

#### **2. Check Each Column Systematically**
- **How:** Go through each column in each table one by one
- **Good for:** Thorough checking, catches problems
- **Use when:** You want to be sure everything is right

### **Recommended: Check Each Column Systematically**
**Why:** More thorough, catches data type problems, format issues, and edge cases that comparison might miss.

## üìã **How to Check the Data (4 Steps)**

### **Step 1: Check Data Types**
- Make sure all columns have correct data types
- Check for unexpected empty fields in required columns
- Make sure numbers are in the right ranges
- Check that dates and times are formatted correctly

### **Step 2: Check Data Transformations**
- Make sure Excel column names were changed to database names correctly
- Check that data cleaning rules were applied
- Make sure calculated fields are correct
- Check that standardization rules were applied (uppercase, trimming, etc.)

### **Step 3: Check Data Relationships**
- Make sure table connections work correctly
- Check that all references between tables are valid
- Make sure business rules are followed
- Check that data relationships make sense

### **Step 4: Check Sample Data**
- Look at random samples from each table
- Check edge cases and special values

## üìä **How to Check Each Table**

### **Table 1: sites (168 records)**

#### **What to Check:**
- [ ] **site_code:** Text, not empty, unique, all uppercase
- [ ] **is_active:** True/false, not empty
- [ ] **waterbody:** Text, can be empty
- [ ] **latitude:** Number, between -90 and 90
- [ ] **longitude:** Number, between -180 and 180
- [ ] **site_type:** Text, can be empty
- [ ] **description:** Text, can be empty
- [ ] **All other fields:** Check they have correct data types

#### **SQL Queries to Run:**
```sql
-- Check for missing coordinates
SELECT site_code, waterbody, latitude, longitude 
FROM sites 
WHERE latitude IS NULL OR longitude IS NULL;

-- Check coordinate ranges
SELECT site_code, latitude, longitude 
FROM sites 
WHERE latitude < -90 OR latitude > 90 OR longitude < -180 OR longitude > 180;

-- Check site code format
SELECT site_code 
FROM sites 
WHERE site_code != UPPER(site_code) OR LENGTH(site_code) < 2;

-- Look at sample data
SELECT * FROM sites LIMIT 10;
```

#### **Known Issues to Look For:**
- 10 sites missing GPS coordinates
- Site code standardization (PR2A‚ÜíPR2a, MI4B‚ÜíMI4b)
- Date format consistency

FROM samples s 
LEFT JOIN sites st ON s.site_code = st.site_code 
WHERE st.site_code IS NULL;

-- Check date ranges
SELECT MIN(sample_date) as earliest, MAX(sample_date) as latest 
FROM samples 
WHERE sample_date IS NOT NULL;

-- Look at sample data
SELECT sample_id, site_code, sample_date, water_temperature, ph, do_ppm 
FROM samples 
ORDER BY sample_date DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

#### **Known Issues to Look For:**
- Site code standardization (PR2A‚ÜíPR2a, MI4B‚ÜíMI4b)
