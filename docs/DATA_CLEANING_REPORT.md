### ❌ Files That Could Not Be Cleaned (2/12)

1. **Database Project Plan.xlsx** - Complex project management file with formatting issues
2. **30 yr StreamWatch Data Analysis.xlsx** - File too large, caused timeout during processing

## Key Data Quality Issues Addressed

### 1. Column Standardization (219 actions)
- **Problem**: 219 unnamed columns across multiple sheets
- **Solution**: Renamed columns based on content analysis and position
- **Impact**: Improved data accessibility and consistency

### 2. Data Type Conversion (100+ actions)
- **Problem**: Mixed data types in water quality parameters
- **Solution**: Converted to appropriate numeric/datetime types
- **Impact**: Enabled proper analysis and calculations

### 3. Empty Column Removal (50+ actions)
- **Problem**: Completely empty columns cluttering datasets
- **Solution**: Identified and removed empty columns
- **Impact**: Reduced file sizes and improved data clarity

### 4. Duplicate Row Removal (100+ actions)
- **Problem**: Duplicate entries in multiple sheets
- **Solution**: Identified and removed duplicate rows
- **Impact**: Improved data accuracy and reduced redundancy

### 5. Column Name Standardization (74 actions)
- **Problem**: Inconsistent column naming conventions
- **Solution**: Standardized names (spaces → underscores, special characters removed)
- **Impact**: Improved data integration and analysis capabilities

## Data Quality Flags Added

Each cleaned dataset now includes:
- **`data_quality_flag`** column with values:
  - `'clean'` - Data passes quality checks
  - `'high_missing'` - Row has >50% missing values
  - `'potential_outlier'` - Values outside normal ranges

## File Size Reductions

| Original File | Original Size | Cleaned Size | Reduction |
|---------------|---------------|--------------|-----------|
| 2024 TWI WQX Submission.xlsx | 1.50 MB | 0.63 MB | 58% |
| All StreamWatch Data.xlsx | 3.71 MB | 0.95 MB | 74% |
| BAT Data Consolidation.xlsx | 1.07 MB | 0.55 MB | 49% |
| Volunteer_Tracking.xlsm | 8.91 MB | 0.06 MB | 99% |
| BATSITES COLLECTED.xlsx | 0.33 MB | 0.28 MB | 15% |
| tblSampleDates.xlsx | 0.37 MB | 0.28 MB | 24% |
| BACT and HAB 2025 Data.xlsx | 1.00 MB | 0.55 MB | 45% |

**Total space saved**: ~12 MB (significant reduction in file sizes)

## Next Steps for The Watershed Institute

### Immediate Actions
1. **Review cleaned data** in the `cleaned_data/` folder
2. **Validate data quality flags** to ensure accuracy
3. **Test data integration** with existing workflows

### Database Development
1. **Use cleaned data as foundation** for database schema design
2. **Implement data validation rules** based on quality flags
3. **Create automated import processes** for new data

### Data Management
1. **Establish data cleaning protocols** for future data collection
2. **Train staff** on data quality standards
3. **Implement regular data audits** using the cleaning scripts

## Technical Details

### Scripts Created
- `data_quality_assessor.py` - Identifies data quality issues
- `data_cleaner.py` - Basic data cleaning functionality
- `comprehensive_data_cleaner.py` - Full-scale data cleaning system

### Dependencies
- pandas
- openpyxl
- numpy

### Output Files
