# StreamWatch Data Pipeline - Project Summary
**For: Watershed Institute Team**  
**Date: December 2024**

---

## 🎯 **What This Project Is**

This project transforms 32 years of StreamWatch environmental monitoring data (1992-2024) from Excel files into a PostgreSQL database for analysis, reporting, and visualization.

**Data includes:**
- 3,608 water quality samples across 168 monitoring sites
- 7,274 macroinvertebrate (bug) records
- 622 bacteria test results
- 50+ volunteer records
- Site locations with GPS coordinates

---

## 📊 **Current Status**

### **✅ Completed:**
- PostgreSQL database created with 14 tables
- ETL pipeline scripts developed
- All source Excel files organized
- Database accessible and ready for use

### **⚠️ In Progress:**
- Data loading partially complete (some tables loaded, others failed due to technical issues)
- ETL pipeline needs debugging for column name mismatches
- Data validation not yet started

### **📋 Next Steps:**
1. Fix ETL pipeline technical issues
2. Complete data loading for all tables
3. Begin systematic data validation
4. Develop dashboards and reporting tools
